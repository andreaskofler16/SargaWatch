# SargaWatch

### WHY ###
Because I was in holiday on my Island Guadeloupe and I could see in my own eyes the problem of the Sargasse (a kind of seaweed) that make some beach suck. But I notice everybody was working hard at cleaning the beach so I came up with a idea. What if people could in live report the state of the beach?  This way people (tourist or locals) will be able to plan for the best experience anytime. :) 

### HOW ###
By allowing people to share their experience on the beach .
People go the the beach and can send a photo of the beach so people don't move to unclean beach for nothing and have a better holiday experience.

### WHAT ###

A Android App (iOS come after) with this ...
